# FPGA project template

This is a GitHub [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for my FPGA projects.

To build your project and send bitstream to the FPGA board just type:

```sh
make && make install
```
